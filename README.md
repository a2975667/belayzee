# Belayzee

People today often have important tasks that requires full attention yet there are many tedious but essential things we have to do. Today many internet services have been putting effort in dealing with this problem yet with a high cost. We want to build a platform that uses some sort of crowdsourcing, or at least someone that can effortlessly help you with your request. BeLayzee is meant to bring people closer and focus to what is the most important of their lives.
