Set up your local directory

Set up Git on your machine if you haven't already.

mkdir /path/to/your/projectcd /path/to/your/projectgit initgit remote add origin https://Yermouth@bitbucket.org/1155049075/trygit.git

Create your first file, commit, and push

echo "Lai Sunny" >> contributors.txtgit add contributors.txtgit commit -m 'Initial commit with contributors'git push -u origin master

Great job, now you're all set up! Get started coding or create a team and invite people to work with you.
